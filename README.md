# OzzyWM - Hammerspoon Window Manager Plugin

As a huge fan of hammerspoon, this is my window manager plugin.

## Installation

Download spoon file from [releases](https://github.com/ozguncagri/OzzyWM/releases) page and install it with double clicking it, then open your hammerspoon config and add this line to it;

```lua
hs.loadSpoon("OzzyWM")
```

then reload your config; you are ready to go.
